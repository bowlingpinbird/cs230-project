In this project, we examined gender imbalance in films by examining a real data set of 50 Hollywood movies and running them through a quantitative test. The original Bechdel-Wallace test which checks if a movie has two named female characters, and if those two characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man. However, this original test does not uncover the deeper core inequalities imbedded in Hollywood films. Hickey et al., reached out to women in film and television and developed 11 new Bechdel Test’s to test whether the film industry has improved in representation of women (2017). 

Inspired by Hickey et al., we look at the same data set of 50 Hollywood movies and create our own Bechdel test (2017). We first create a visual representation of the movies and actors examined by using a graph. Our test is similar to the uphold test created by Hickey et al.. The uphold test proposed by Rory Uphold tests whether the on-stage crew is at least 50% women (2017). Rather than looking at on-stage crew, our test looks at the set of actors for a specific movie and checks whether at least 50% of the cast are female.
